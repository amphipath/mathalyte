      <p>do you feel like your maths lessons just don&#x27;t help? i&#x27;ve got an alternative way of looking at the subject. i can&#x27;t guarantee it&#x27;ll help, but it&#x27;ll certainly be different from what you&#x27;re used to.</p>

      <p>I'm one of those easily detested bastards you'd have to have the utmost misfortune to be stuck in a class with. The guy who'd effortlessly complete every math test thrown at the class in about half the time allotted when you'd have been stuck on that one question that teacher threw in just to screw with everyone. The guy who'd constantly say the subject was easy with full knowledge of how not everyone had the same talent as him, just to rub it in. The guy who'd, in a rare earnest effort to try to help you out with a troublesome question, assume that you'd be able to follow his absolutely incomprehensible train of thought and eventually get frustrated at the fact that despite his best effort to explain it, you just won't "get it".</p>

<p>But what does it mean to "get it"? How is it that progress on a mathematics problem seems to be so discontinuous; the way you could be haplessly stuck one second, and just have that Eureka moment and solve it the next instant?</p>

<p>The answer: <strong>Insights</strong>. <a href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?comic=031212">That one little thing</a> you could do to that question to make it so obvious, or that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dcC76Rp.gif">one observation</a> that would've made for such a quick and elegant answer. In the stories of Gauss' theorem you'd hear when starting to learn about algebra, where he was (supposedly) the only kid in the class to realise 1 + 2 + 3 + .. + 99 + 100 = (1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + .... + (50 + 51) = 101 * 50 = 5050 in seconds while everyone else trudged along from 780 to 820 and then to 861; that was an insight.</p>

<p>Too bad insights aren't common. If they were, the borderline-predatory tuition industry wouldn't be so lucrative. So what about all those people who don't have these insights handed to them on a silver platter? I refuse to believe they're out of luck; after all, as capricious as these insights may be, I always had a train of thought when I realised them. Is it possible for me to break down these thought processes into general patterns that everyone can internalise by habit, and hence become more able to get these insights by themselves?</p>

<p>And so begins this journey into mathematics pedagogy. Rather than focusing on the MapleStory-esque grind to ace tests by doing as many exercises, tests and past-year papers as possible, I'm looking to distil the processes of problem-solving so that weaker students can have a more long-term solution to improving their mathematical ability. The blog's title reflects this philosophy in teaching; mathematics as a subject, rather than individual mathematical concepts, will be the analyte of thorough dissection.</p>

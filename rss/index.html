The <a href="http://www.cie.org.uk/images/155898-november-2012-examiner-report.pdf">examiner's report</a> (question 9) states that "completely correct solutions were rare" and "many could not translate the given information into a correct and useful diagram".</p>

<p id="latex">A plane, whose speed in still air is 420kmph, travels directly from A to B, a distance of 1000km. The bearing of B from A is 230 degrees and there is a wind of 80kmph from the east.</p>

<p id="latex">(i) Find the bearing on which the plane was steered.<br>  
(ii) Find the time taken for the journey.</p>

<p>There's a question that you can ask yourself that will always guide you closer towards the answer. <strong>What's preventing me from putting whatever I like as the answer?</strong> What's preventing me from saying that the plane went 230 degrees, and made a straight dash for B from A?</p>

<p>Wait. The wind would blow it off course and then it'd be some distance to the left of B. So why can't I just say that the plane went straight down south, and let the wind carry it? Well, the plane has a fixed speed of 420kmph. The wind might not be strong enough and it'd go too far down by the time it's "left" enough to hit B, or the wind could still be too strong.</p>

<p>Asking yourself "why not?" basically forces you to re-examine the question more closely, actively look out for information the question might have that would prohibit you from otherwise having a free ride to a correct answer. There's always that <em>something</em> in the question that doesn't let you have a free lunch.</p>

<p>So what are the <em>somethings</em> in this question that made it such that "completely correct solutions were rare"? The plane goes at <strong>420kmph</strong>, A and B are fixed places <strong>1000km</strong> apart and B is to the southwest of A, on a line <strong>230 degrees</strong> with respect to North from A. There is a constant force making it so that every hour, the plane is <strong>80km</strong> further to the west of where it planned to be.</p>

<p>So then you'd draw the diagram. You'd make a convenient but imaginary point called C which is some way (let's call it $80x$) to the right of B. C is where the plane would go if there was no wind. And the total effect the wind has on the plane would push it from C to B (hence $80x$). But what about the distance from A to C? <strong>What's preventing you</strong> from saying it's 1000000km, or 1km? Well, the wind is fixed and so is the plane's speed. Since C is where the plane would be without wind, if the wind pushed it 80km over one hour then obviously C has to be 420km from A, and so on. So AC is $420x$.</p>

<p>And  after that, you have a pretty triangle. Only thing that's missing is that it'd be nice if there were a few angles to play around with. <strong>What's preventing you</strong> from putting any old angle you like then? Oh wait. B is a fixed bearing from A. Since BC is a straight horizontal line pointing to the east, $\angle ABC$ is 40 degrees, after some angle-playing.</p>

<p>By this time it should be pretty clear that it's a trigonometry question. You have three lengths, one unknown ($x$, or the time taken), and an angle. Doesn't that already mean you can figure out all the other angles, though? You remember the sine rule and pull out your calculator to find $\angle BAC$. What's that last angle, though? What's preventing you from saying it's 123 degrees? Oops, well you already have the other two angles and this is a triangle, so you find $140^\circ - \angle BAC$ and that's the last angle you need.</p>

<p>What was the time taken, though? It was $x$, wasn't it? That sine rule should find that out pretty quick.</p>

<h2 id="howusefulisthis">how useful is this?</h2>

<p>It's pretty damn useful when it comes to questions like "solve for x" or "find y". But as you go to A levels and beyond, you'd find that questions aren't like that anymore. "Prove" or "Show that" questions pop up way more often than before, and many times this question isn't as easily answerable. Still, making it a habit to ask yourself this question helps <strong>root</strong> you to the exam question by constantly remind yourself to look out for just how the exam question is restricting you.</p>

<p>You would notice, though, that at two parts of the question (making up C and realising the sine rule was relevant) the question couldn't really help. These are what I'd call "insight bottlenecks" where many people would stop if they just didn't have the fortune to see these steps. Practicing past-year papers is certainly a way to get used to encountering these kinds of steps, but this blog isn't here to repeat what everyone else has said to you already. Examining these insights would have to come with another article.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
